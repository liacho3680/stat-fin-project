# Statistical Methods in Finance â€“ Portfolio Analysis Project
This repository contains the code, data, and results for Group 31â€™s Statistical Methods in Finance final project at Columbia University (Spring 2023). The project investigates portfolio optimization, risk management, and dependency modeling for a selection of 15 publicly traded stocks and the S&P 500 index.

## Project Overview
We analyzed historical monthly return data for 15 selected stocks to:

- Assess descriptive statistics, normality, and stationarity.

- Construct and evaluate Minimum Variance and Tangency Portfolios.

- Calculate Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).

- Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

- Model joint dependencies using copulas.

The work combines time series analysis, Markowitz portfolio theory, risk metrics, and multivariate modeling to gain insights into portfolio construction and asset risk.

## Key Findings
- Return Distributions: Most assets and the S&P 500 are approximately normally distributed with some stationarity.

- Tangency Portfolio:

  - Expected return: ~17.43%

  - Standard deviation: ~30.87%

  - Sharpe ratio: ~0.42

- Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP): Lower VaR than most individual assets, with KO holding the largest weight.

- Risk Metrics:

  - Highest VaR: TSLA ($84,715.87)

  - Lowest VaR: KO ($26,945.52)

  - Risk levels significantly reduced when combining the tangency portfolio with risk-free assets.

- PCA: First four principal components explain the majority of return variance.

- Copula Modeling: Normal copula provided the best fit for joint distribution.
